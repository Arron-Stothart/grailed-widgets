## Widget Types

- **Price Drops**: Quick glance at saved items that have recently had price reductions.
- ~~**Saved Searches Widget**: Stay updated with new items from saved searches and favourited catagories.~~
- ~~**Quick Actions**: Control panel for quick access to new messages and essential app features.~~

## Implementation Details
- Built with Swift, SwiftUI, WidgetKit, SwiftSoup (extraction for demo purposes)
- Designed in Figma using Grailed assets, attempting to adhere to their design practices
- Currently uses sample items to simulate data fetching. These placeholder endpoints would be replaced with official Grailed API endpoints + WidgetKit's timeline provider in a production version.
